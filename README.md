**Introduction**
The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. It involves shifting each letter in a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This project aims to provide a basic implementation of the Caesar cipher in Python, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages using this technique.

**Usage**
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the main.py script using the following command:

python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message and provide the necessary inputs.

Features
Encryption of messages using the Caesar cipher technique.
Decryption of encrypted messages using the same technique.
Support for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Adjustable shift value for varying levels of encryption.
User-friendly command-line interface.
Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Clone this repository or download the ZIP archive and extract it.
Example
Suppose you want to encrypt the message "Hello, Caesar!" with a shift of 3:


plaintext
Plain_text:  Hello
Shift:      5
Cipher_text: mjqqt
You can then use the decryption feature to revert the encrypted message back to its original form.

We hope you find this Caesar Cipher Python Project educational and useful. Happy coding!
